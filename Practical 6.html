    <h1 id="lin">LinkedIn</h1>
    <p>
        A lot of people think that publishing content somewhere other than their own blog would not really be beneficial, because they would be driving traffic to some other website. That is why many bloggers choose to stick to their blogs and not post content elsewhere, except when they engage in guest blogging. However, blogging on LinkedIn can actually drive more readers to your blog. According to the latest LinkedIn statistics, LinkedIn has more than 500 million users, 250 million of which are active on the platform on a monthly basis. These numbers speak volumes about the exposure and reach that you could have if you were to put your efforts into blogging on LinkedIn. The best part? Publishing on the platform is completely free. You don't have to buy a domain name, pay for ads or anything else to boost your exposure all you need to do is sign up for an account and start sharing content and making connections.
